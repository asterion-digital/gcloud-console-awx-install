* Deploy K3s on Cloud Shell

** Introduction
We needed to test the deployment of [[http://k3s.io][K3s]] and didn't want to pay/set up a new virtual machine for this.
Instead, we chose to deploy K3s inside a free [[https://cloud.google.com/shell][Google Cloud Platform cloud shell]].

Use the steps below to run K3s in Cloud Shell:

#+name: Deploy K3s on Cloud Shell
#+begin_src bash

# Download the K3s binary from Github to Cloud Shell
wget https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.21.1%2Bk3s1/k3s

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x k3s

# Run K3s in the background
sudo ./k3s server --snapshotter native&
#+end_src

Click the button below to clone the Github repo directly into Cloud Shell 

#+NAME:   fig:CloudShellButton
[[https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/asterion-digital/gcloud-console-awx-install][./images/open-btn.png]]

After running this script, validate the node is ready

#+name: Validate K3s deployment
#+begin_src bash

# Check K3s cluster
sudo ./k3s kubectl get nodes
#+end_src
